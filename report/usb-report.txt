Here's a summary of the current state of the Linux USB subsystem.

If the information in here is incorrect, or anyone knows of any
outstanding issues not listed here, please let me know.

List of outstanding regressions from 2.6.15:
	- none known.

List of outstanding regressions from older kernel versions:
	- one nasty bug, http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6078
	  is plaguing some people since 2.6.15 came out.  Right now some
	  people have reported that 2.6.16-rc5 fixes the issue, and none
	  of the Linux USB developers can duplicate it.  No one has
	  reported that it is still present in 2.6.16-rc5 either, so we
	  don't know if this is fixed yet or not.
	- omninet driver is broken since 2.6.13 or so.  Currently being
	  debugged.

Here is a list of the current outstanding bugs for the USB subsystem as
tracked at bugzilla.kernel.org.  Note that a lot of these are still
sitting in the NEEDSINFO state waiting for people to reply with more
information or testing.  If anyone can help out with any of these,
please add information to the bug reports.

Future patches that are currently in my quilt tree (as found at
	http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/
) for the USB subsystem:

	- UHCI reworks hopefully making it easier to maintain and fixes
	  a few power management issues
	- kzalloc fixes for the drivers/usb/ tree
	- ehci support for new controller type, and fixes for others.
	- USB gadget driver updates
	- USB video driver additions and updates.
	- HID error handling rework
	- semaphore to mutex rework
	- other minor bugfixes that are not really critical or too big
	  to go into 2.6.16 at this period of time.

No new USB driver API changes are pending that I am aware of.


Was this summary useful for people?  Anything that I should add to it?

thanks,

greg k-h
